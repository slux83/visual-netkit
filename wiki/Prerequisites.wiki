The tool should compile successfully if you have a standard *Linux* build
environment. Support for other environments (e.g., BSD, potentially Windows) is
not far from being achieved, but not currently provided. Remember that NetKit actually works only on *GNU/Linux*

The only requirement is to have a version of the Qt development files that is
at least as recent as _4.4_.
