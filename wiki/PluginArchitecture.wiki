As you can see, all wheel around the `PluginRegistry` _Singleton_ class.
This is the controller of mappings between BaseElement and the plugins attached, where BaseElement is a Virtual machine, Collision domain or a link.

The Registry offer a directory service to get and init a new plugin passing its name. In this case, the loader fartory class initialize a new instance of the selected plugins returning its Proxy.

The only possible way that plugin have to comunicate with the system is through the proxy, because it is coupled with mappings and other controllers.
