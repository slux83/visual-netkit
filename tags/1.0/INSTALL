To compile this program, you have to install Qt >= 4.4 inside your Linux Box

When you are inside the application root directory, run the script `build.sh -r`
to compile the binary and plugins in release mode.

All binary stuffs are located inside bin/. You must run Visual Netkib by
bin/visualnetkit.sh because you have export VISUAL_NETKIT_PLUGINS environment
variable that contains plugins paths.

Enjoy!
