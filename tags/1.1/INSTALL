To compile this program, you have to install Qt >= 4.4 inside your Linux Box

When you are inside the application root directory, run the script `build.sh -r`
to compile the binary and plugins in release mode.

All binary stuff is located inside bin/. You must run Visual Netkit by
launching bin/visualnetkit.sh, because you need to export the
VISUAL_NETKIT_PLUGINS environment variable that contains plugin paths.

Enjoy!
